- People before code: If any of the following rules are violated, the pull-requests must not be rejected. This is to create an easy and joyful onboarding process for new programmers and first-time contributors.

- Single commit per pull request and name the commit as something meaningful, example: Adding <-your-name-> in students/mentors section.

- Reference the issue numbers in the commit message if it resolves an open issue. Follow the [PR Template](https://github.com/opencodeiiita/SaveMyForm-Frontend/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) Issue: < ISSUE NUMBER >

- Provide the link to live gh-pages from your forked repository or relevant screenshot for easier review.

- Pull Request older than 3 days with no response from the contributor shall be marked closed.

- Do not make PR which is not related to any issues. You can create an issue and solve it once we approve them.

- Avoid duplicate PRs, if need be comment on the older PR with the PR number of the follow-up (new PR) and close the obsolete PR yourself.
